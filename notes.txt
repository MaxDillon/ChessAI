Intellij protobuf plugin does not *compile* protobufs. It just does syntax highlighting.
Will need to invoke from the command line, or will need to configure build tools to do it.

The generated .java classes are not self-contained, and still have dependencies on the
Google protobuf distribution.  Will need to build this separately and include as an external
library in the project.

It's convenient to get the protobuf dependencies with maven. And it may be convenient
to run the proto compilier this way too.

We set up the initial maven pom.xml like so:

  mvn -B archetype:generate -DgroupId=max.dillon -DartifactId=quest

This also creates src/main/java/... and src/test/java/... directories.

To generate GameGrammar.java from game_grammar.proto:

${anacondadir}/bin/protoc src/main/proto/game_grammar.proto --java_out=src/main/java
