        <p> F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby explores the implications of class and wealth, as well as their
            mesmerizing allure. One symbol that Fitzgerald uses throughout the story is Daisy’s voice. Fitzgerald’s many
            descriptions of her enchanting and musical voice demonstrate her social status, her money, and an
            inescapable attraction. Gatsby’s idealized image of Daisy is dominated by her voice. That same voice takes
            ahold of Gatsby, and draws him on an endless pursuit to his eventual death. Fitzgerald’s descriptions of
            Daisy’s singsong voice characterize it as that of a Siren: one that draws in men and then drowns them at
            sea. Thus, Daisy’s voice is a vessel for Fitzgerald’s theme that the promise of class and wealth, though
            alluring, is one of glamorous deceit.

        <p>From the start, Fitzgerald establishes Daisy’s voice as one of high social status. This is apparent even in
            her first words: “‘I’m p-paralyzed with happiness.’ She laughed again, as if she said something very witty”
            (8). Despite her stumbling over her words, and her previous failed “attempt to rise” in order to greet Nick,
            she maintains her composure by laughing it off “as if” she had said something “witty” (8). This carefree
            recovery displays Daisy’s comfort with her class. The meaning of her first words further develop this air of
            class; she is so stiff from sitting on the couch, she claims to have paralysis. This reveals how little a
            woman of her social standing has to do, but to lounge on the couch.</p>
